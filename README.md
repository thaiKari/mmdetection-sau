Code and playground for my specialisation project and masters thesis.


Code related to pre and postprocessing is found in a seperate repository: #TODO link to repository

Please note that this repository contains a lot of experimentation and was not intended for sharing so the code is not particularly pretty.

- Starter code for Specialisation Project is OpenMMLab's open source object detection toolbox: https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection

- Starter Code for Masters project is Hukkel√•s' starter code for the assignments in TDT4265 - Computer Vision and Deep Learning at NTNU: https://github.com/hukkelas/TDT4265-StarterCode

# Code and playground for my Specialisation Project and Masters Thesis.
- Specialisation Project, Detecting Sheep in Drone Images by Deep Learning, Desember 2019 
[K.Johannessen Specialisation Project](FinalProjectVersions/K.Johannessen_Specialisation project_final-compressed.pdf)

- Master Thesis, Towards Improved Sheep Roundup Using Deep Learning-Based Detection on MultiChannel RGB and Infrared UAV Imagery, June 2020 
[K.Johannessen Masters Thesis](FinalProjectVersions/K.Johannessen_Masters_Thesis_final-compressed.pdf)

Code related to pre and postprocessing is found in a seperate repository: https://github.com/thaiKari/sheepDetector. If you use my work. Please give me credit.
## Please note that this repository contains a lot of experimentation and was not intended for sharing so the code is not being particularly pretty.
